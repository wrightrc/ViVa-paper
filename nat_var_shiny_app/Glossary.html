  <h4>Nucleotide Diversity</h4>
  <h5>A statistic used to describe the diversity of a genetic sequence in a given population or sample. Nucleotide diversity for a given sequence can be defined as the probability of drawing two sequences at random from the popuation that are not identical</h5>

  <h4>Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)</h4>
  <h5>A single nucelotide polymorhpism is a difference of a single nucleotide in genomes of idividuals of a population. This can include a change in base, or a insertion or deletion. For the data analysed here, insertions of more than one nucleotide are included, but insertions and deletions are generally uncommon on protein coding regions of active genes. </h5>
