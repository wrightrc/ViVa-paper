ToDo
Little fixes
- "Diversity plot" handling for premature stops (and frame shifts)?
- update comments and documentation in code (mainly VCF_Utils.R)
- Add tair symbol to tab1 tables eg. "AT1G12820(AFB3)"
- clean up tables (shorter column names, round to 3-5 decimals, etc)

New Functionalities
- hover-over/readme for each tab and table
- ability to get all accessions with a mutation
- Search by tair_symbol
- map accessions from multiple genes at once (checkboxes for genes and variants)
- show diversity on a histogram of genome wide stats


DONE!!!
- about tab, with bibliography glossary...
- All mentions of ecotype changed to accession
- make download buttons more descriptive about what is being downloaded
- add download button for "gene_info" table
- add radio button for coding/missense/non-coding to "SNP map"
- Highlight all accessions containing the same SNP when selecting in "SNP map" [layer select tool allows isolating one or more SNPs]
- add exclude NA accessions checkbox to "SNP map" [layer select tool, bottom left corner of map]
- make diversity filter slider logrithmic on map tab
- make table in map output a searchable table [done, as well as on plotting tab]
- add a filter to the map page to select specific SNPs after submitting gene, but before generating map.
