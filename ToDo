- make download buttons more descriptive about what is being downloaded
- add download button for "gene_info" table
- add radio button for coding/missense/non-coding to "SNP map"
- Highlight all accessions containing the same SNP when selecting in "SNP map" [layer select tool allows isolating one or more SNPs]
- add exclude NA accessions checkbox to "SNP map" [layer select tool, bottom left corner of map]
- make diversity filter slider logrithmic on map tab
- make table in map output a searchable table [done, as well as on plotting tab]
- add a filter to the map page to select specific SNPs after submitting gene, but before generating map.
