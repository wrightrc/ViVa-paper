  abstract = {The plant hormone auxin regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development. We report that in Arabidopsis, auxin response is dependent on a ubiquitin-ligase (E3) complex called SCFTIR1. The complex consists of proteins related to yeast Skp1p and Cdc53p called ASK and AtCUL1, respectively, as well as the F-box protein TIR1. Mutations in either ASK1 or TIR1 result in decreased auxin response. Further, overexpression of TIR1 promotes auxin response suggesting that SCFTIR1 is limiting for the response. These results provide new support for a model in which auxin action depends on the regulated proteolysis of repressor proteins},

  abstract = {The plant hormone auxin can regulate gene expression by destabilizing members of the Aux/IAA family of transcriptional repressors. Auxin-induced Aux/IAA degradation requires the protein-ubiquitin ligase SCF(TIR1), with auxin acting to enhance the interaction between the Aux/IAAs and SCF(TIR1). SKP1, Cullin, and an F-box-containing protein (SCF)-mediated degradation is an important component of many eukaryotic signaling pathways. In all known cases to date, the interaction between the targets and their cognate SCFs is regulated by signal-induced modification of the target. The mechanism by which auxin promotes the interaction between SCF(TIR1) and Aux/IAAs is not understood, but current hypotheses propose auxin-induced phosphorylation, hydroxylation, or proline isomerization of the Aux/IAAs. We found no evidence to support these hypotheses or indeed that auxin induces any stable modification of Aux/IAAs to increase their affinity for SCF(TIR1). Instead, we present data suggesting that auxin promotes the SCF(TIR1)-Aux/IAA interaction by affecting the SCF component, TIR1, or proteins tightly associated with it},

  abstract = {Auxin is a pivotal plant hormone that controls many aspects of plant growth and development. Perceived by a small family of F-box proteins including transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1), auxin regulates gene expression by promoting SCF ubiquitin-ligase-catalysed degradation of the Aux/IAA transcription repressors, but how the TIR1 F-box protein senses and becomes activated by auxin remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structures of the Arabidopsis TIR1-ASK1 complex, free and in complexes with three different auxin compounds and an Aux/IAA substrate peptide. These structures show that the leucine-rich repeat domain of TIR1 contains an unexpected inositol hexakisphosphate co-factor and recognizes auxin and the Aux/IAA polypeptide substrate through a single surface pocket. Anchored to the base of the TIR1 pocket, auxin binds to a partially promiscuous site, which can also accommodate various auxin analogues. Docked on top of auxin, the Aux/IAA substrate peptide occupies the rest of the TIR1 pocket and completely encloses the hormone-binding site. By filling in a hydrophobic cavity at the protein interface, auxin enhances the TIR1-substrate interactions by acting as a 'molecular glue'. Our results establish the first structural model of a plant hormone receptor},

In the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, recent studies of natural variation have led to the identification of genes underlying ecologically important complex traits, and provided new insights about the processes of genome evolution, geographic population structure, and the selective mechanisms shaping complex trait variation in natural populations. These advances illustrate the potential for a new synthesis to elucidate mechanisms for the adaptive evolution of complex traits from nucleotide sequences to real-world environments.},

  abstract = {Author Summary   The phytohormone auxin plays a diverse and critical role in plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis, the F-box protein TIR1 is a component of an E3 SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex that serves as the auxin receptor and directs the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of repressors of auxin signaling known as the Aux/IAA proteins. Little is known regarding the stoichiometry of the SKP1, CUL1, RBX1 and TIR1 subunits that comprise the SCF TIR1  complex. Here, we show that TIR1 is capable of oligomerization  in planta . We also show that mutant alleles that abolish TIR1 oligomerization impair the degradation of known SCF TIR1  substrates and fail to restore auxin signaling and response in  tir1  loss-of-function genetic backgrounds. The results suggest that TIR1 homo-oligomerization is an important aspect of the regulation of SCF TIR1  function and auxin signaling.},
