  abstract = {Alignment of large and diverse sequence sets is a common task in biological investigations, yet there remains considerable room for improvement in alignment quality. Multiple sequence alignment programs tend to reach maximal accuracy when aligning only a few sequences, and then diminish steadily as more sequences are added. This drop in accuracy can be partly attributed to a build-up of error and ambiguity as more sequences are aligned. Most high-throughput sequence alignment algorithms do not use contextual information under the assumption that sites are independent. This study examines the extent to which local sequence context can be exploited to improve the quality of large multiple sequence alignments.},

In this paper, we expand on a previously developed test for selection that could be conducted assuming a Gaussian mutation effect distribution by developing approaches to also incorporate any of a family of heavy-tailed Laplace distributions of mutational effects. We apply the test to detect directional natural selection on five traits along the divergence of Columbia and Landsberg lineages of Arabidopsis thaliana, constituting the first test for natural selection in any organism using quantitative trait locus and mutation accumulation data to quantify the intensity of directional selection on a phenotypic trait. We demonstrate that the results of the test for selection can depend on the mutation effect distribution specified. Using the distributions exhibiting the best fit to mutation accumulation data, we infer that natural directional selection caused divergence in the rosette diameter and trichome density traits of the Columbia and Landsberg lineages.},

The massive variation in genome size identified by flow cytometry seems largely to be due to 45S rDNA copy number variation, with lines from northern Sweden having particularly large numbers of copies. Strong selection is evident in the form of long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as in LD between nearby compensatory mutations.

  abstract = {Detecting positive selection in species with heterogeneous habitats and complex demography is notoriously difficult and prone to statistical biases. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exemplifies this problem: In spite of the large amounts of data, little evidence for classic selective sweeps has been found. Moreover, many aspects of the demography are unclear, which makes it hard to judge whether the few signals are indeed signs of selection, or false positives caused by demographic events. Here, we focus on Swedish A. thaliana and we find that the demography can be approximated as a two-population model. Careful analysis of the data shows that such a two island model is characterized by a very old split time that significantly predates the last glacial maximum followed by secondary contact with strong migration. We evaluate selection based on this demography and find that this secondary contact model strongly affects the power to detect sweeps. Moreover, it affects the power differently for northern Sweden (more false positives) as compared with southern Sweden (more false negatives). However, even when the demographic history is accounted for, sweep signals in northern Sweden are stronger than in southern Sweden, with little or no positional overlap. Further simulations including the complex demography and selection confirm that this is not compatible with global selection acting on both populations, and thus can be taken as evidence for local selection within subpopulations of Swedish A. thaliana. This study demonstrates the necessity of combining demographic analyses and sweep scans for the detection of selection, particularly when selection acts predominantly local.},

Much of the modern field of population genetics is premised on particular models of what an organism's population structure is and how it behaves. The classic models generally start with the idea of a single randomly mating population that has reached an evolutionary equilibrium. Many models relax some of these assumptions, allowing for phenomena such as assortative mating, discrete sub-populations with migration, self-fertilization, and sex-ratio distortion. Virtually all models, however, have as their core premise the notion that there exist classes of exchangeable individuals each of which represents an identical, independent sample from that class' distribution. For certain organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, these models do an excellent job of describing how populations work. For other organisms, such as humans, these models can be reasonable approximations but require a great deal of care in assembling samples and can begin to break down as sampling becomes locally dense. For the vast majority of organisms the applicability of these models has never been investigated.},

  abstract = {The simultaneous analysis of multiple genomic loci is a powerful approach to studying the effects of population history and natural selection on patterns of genetic variation of a species. By surveying nucleotide sequence polymorphism at 334 randomly distributed genomic regions in 12 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined whether a standard neutral model of nucleotide sequence polymorphism is consistent with observed data. The average nucleotide diversity was 0.0071 for total sites and 0.0083 for silent sites. Although levels of diversity are variable among loci, no correlation with local recombination rate was observed, but polymorphism levels were correlated for physically linked loci ($<$250 kb). We found that observed distributions of Tajima's D- and D/Dmin- and of Fu and Li's D-, D*- and F-, F*-statistics differed significantly from the expected distributions under a standard neutral model due to an excess of rare polymorphisms and high variances. Observed and expected distributions of Fay and Wu's H were not different, suggesting that demographic processes and not selection at multiple loci are responsible for the deviation from a neutral model. Maximum-likelihood comparisons of alternative demographic models like logistic population growth, glacial refugia, or past bottlenecks did not produce parameter estimates that were more consistent with observed patterns. However, exclusion of highly polymorphic ``outlier loci'' resulted in a fit to the logistic growth model. Various tests of neutrality revealed a set of candidate loci that may evolve under selection.},

Many DNA changes are believed to have little to no functional effect, and a neutral process will best explain their evolution. Thus, a central task is to discover which changes had positive fitness consequences and were subject to Darwinian natural selection during the course of evolution. Due the size and complexity of modern molecular datasets, the field has come to rely extensively on statistical modeling techniques to meet this analytical challenge. For DNA sequences that encode proteins, one of the most powerful approaches is to employ a statistical model of codon evolution. This unit provides a general introduction to the practice of modeling codon evolution using the statistical framework of maximum likelihood. Four real-data analysis activities are used to illustrate the principles of parameter estimation, robustness, hypothesis testing, and site classification. Each activity includes an explicit analytical protocol based on programs provided by the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package.},

  abstract = {Author Summary The interactions of proteins with each other are essential for almost all biological processes. Many of the sites of protein contact have evolved to maintain these interactions, but use different sets of amino acid residues. As a result, the residues at a contact site in a protein from one species might not allow a protein interaction when they are tested in a second species. This property underlies the idea of inter-species complementation assays, which test the effect of replacing protein segments from one species by their equivalents from another species. However, this approach has been highly limited in the number of changes that could be analyzed in a single study. Here, we present a novel approach that combines a high-throughput analysis of mutations in a single protein with the set of natural sequences corresponding to evolutionarily divergent variants of this protein. This integration step allows us to map at high resolution both sites of inter-protein interaction as well as intra-protein interaction. Our approach can be used with proteins that have limited functional and structural data, and it can be applied to improve the performance of computational tools that use sequence homology to predict function.},

SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here we review comparative genomic approaches that are bridging the sequence-function and genotype-phenotype gaps. Reverse genomic approaches aim to analyse sequence to assign function, whereas forward genomic approaches start from a phenotype and aim to identify the underlying genotype responsible.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomic approaches, pioneered in budding yeasts, have resulted in dramatic improvements in our understanding of the function of both genes and regulatory sequences. Analogous studies in other systems, including humans, demonstrate the ubiquity of comparative genomic approaches. Recently, forward genomic approaches, exploiting natural variation within yeast populations, have started to offer powerful insights into how genotype influences phenotype and even the ability to predict phenotypes.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Comparative genomic experiments are defining the fundamental rules that govern complex traits in natural populations from yeast to humans. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Systems Biology of Microorganisms.},

At $<$1\% false discovery rate, we detected 77,420 single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) with distinct patterns of variation across the genome. Total and pair-wise diversity was higher near the centromeres and the heterochromatic knob region, but overall diversity was positively correlated with recombination rate (R(2) = 3.1\%). The difference between total and pair-wise SFP diversity is a relative measure contrasting diversifying or frequency-dependent selection, similar to Tajima's D, and can be calibrated by the empirical genome-wide distribution. Each unique locus, centered on a gene, has a diversity and selection score that suggest a relative role in past evolutionary processes. Homologs of disease resistance (R) genes include members with especially high levels of diversity often showing frequency-dependent selection and occasionally evidence of a past selective sweep. Receptor-like and S-locus proteins also contained members with elevated levels of diversity and signatures of selection, whereas other gene families, bHLH, F-box, and RING finger proteins, showed more typical levels of diversity. SFPs identified with the gene expression array also provide an empirical hybridization polymorphism background for studies of gene expression polymorphism and are available through the genome browser http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/AtSFP.},

Since the time of Darwin, biologists have worked to identify instances of evolutionary adaptation. At the molecular scale, it is understood that adaptation should induce more genetic changes at amino acid altering sites in the genome, compared to amino acid\textendash{}preserving sites. The ratio of substitution rates at such sites, denoted dN/dS, is therefore commonly used to detect proteins undergoing adaptation. This test was originally developed for application to distantly diverged genetic sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions along independent evolutionary lineages. Nonetheless, the dN/dS statistics are also frequently applied to genetic sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent transient polymorphisms, not substitutions. Here, we show that the behavior of the dN/dS statistic is very different in these two cases. In particular, when applied to sequences from a single population, the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the strength of natural selection, and the anticipated signature of adaptive evolution, dN/dS$>$1, is violated. These results have implications for the interpretation of genetic variation sampled from a population. In particular, these results suggest that microbes may experience substantially stronger selective forces than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Natural epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic diversity, but to understand its contribution to such diversity, its interaction with genetic variation requires further investigation. Here we report population-wide DNA sequencing of genomes, transcriptomes and methylomes of wild Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Single cytosine methylation polymorphisms are not linked to genotype. However, the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay amongst differentially methylated regions targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation is similar to the rate for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association analyses of these RNA-directed DNA methylation regions with genetic variants identified thousands of methylation quantitative trait loci, which revealed the population estimate of genetically dependent methylation variation. Analysis of invariably methylated transposons and genes across this population indicates that loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation are epigenetically activated in pollen and seeds, which facilitates proper development of these structures.},

A survey of the general extent of natural variation to auxin stimuli revealed significant physiological variation among 20 genetically diverse natural accessions. Moreover, we observed dramatic variation on the global transcriptome level after induction of auxin responses in seven accessions. Although we detect isolated cases of major-effect polymorphisms, sequencing of signaling genes revealed sequence conservation, making selective pressures that favor functionally different protein variants among accessions unlikely. However, coexpression analyses of a priori defined auxin signaling networks identified variations in the transcriptional equilibrium of signaling components. In agreement with this, cluster analyses of genome-wide expression profiles followed by analyses of a posteriori defined gene networks revealed accession-specific auxin responses. We hypothesize that quantitative distortions in the ratios of interacting signaling components contribute to the detected transcriptional variation, resulting in physiological variation of auxin responses among accessions.},

The epigenome orchestrates genome accessibility,~functionality, and three-dimensional structure. Because epigenetic variation can impact transcription and thus phenotypes, it may contribute to adaptation. Here, we report 1,107 high-quality single-base resolution methylomes and 1,203 transcriptomes from the 1001 Genomes collection of Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the genetic basis of methylation variation is highly complex, geographic origin is a major predictor of genome-wide DNA methylation levels and of altered gene expression caused by epialleles. Comparison to cistrome and epicistrome datasets identifies associations between transcription factor binding sites, methylation, nucleotide variation, and co-expression modules. Physical maps for nine of the most diverse genomes reveal how transposons and other structural variants shape the epigenome, with dramatic effects on immunity genes. The 1001 Epigenomes Project provides a comprehensive resource for understanding how variation in DNA methylation contributes to molecular and non-molecular phenotypes in natural populations of the most studied model plant.},

  abstract = {Although pioneered by human geneticists as a potential solution to the challenging problem of finding the genetic basis of common human diseases, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have, owing to advances in genotyping and sequencing technology, become an obvious general approach for studying the genetics of natural variation and traits of agricultural importance. They are particularly useful when inbred lines are available, because once these lines have been genotyped they can be phenotyped multiple times, making it possible (as well as extremely cost effective) to study many different traits in many different environments, while replicating the phenotypic measurements to reduce environmental noise. Here we demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a GWA study of 107 phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely distributed, predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known to harbour considerable genetic variation for many adaptively important traits. Our results are dramatically different from those of human GWA studies, in that we identify many common alleles of major effect, but they are also, in many cases, harder to interpret because confounding by complex genetics and population structure make it difficult to distinguish true associations from false. However, a-priori candidates are significantly over-represented among these associations as well, making many of them excellent candidates for follow-up experiments. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of GWA studies in A. thaliana and suggests that the approach will be appropriate for many other organisms.},

  abstract = {$\blacksquare$ Abstract\hspace{0.6em}Currently, genetic variation is probably the most important basic resource for plant biology. In addition to the variation artificially generated by mutants in model plants, naturally occurring genetic variation is extensively found for most species, including Arabidopsis. In many cases, natural variation present among accessions is multigenic, which has historically hampered its analysis. However, the exploitation of this resource down to the molecular level has now become feasible, especially in model species like Arabidopsis, where several genes accounting for natural variation have already been identified. Dissecting this variation requires first a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, which in Arabidopsis has proven very effective by using recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Second, identifying the particular gene and the nucleotide polymorphism underlying QTL is the major challenge, and is now feasible by combining high-throughput genetics and functional genomic strategies. The analysis of Arabidopsis natural genetic variation is providing unique knowledge from functional, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives. This is illustrated by reviewing current research in two different biological fields: flowering time and plant growth. The analysis of Arabidopsis natural variation for flowering time revealed the identity of several genes, some of which correspond to genes with previously unknown function. In addition, for many other traits such as those related to primary metabolism and plant growth, Arabidopsis QTL analyses are detecting loci with small effects that are not easily amenable by mutant approaches, and which might provide new insights into the networks of gene regulation.},

To examine the patterns of, and the forces shaping, sequence variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed high-density array resequencing of 20 diverse strains (accessions). More than 1 million nonredundant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at moderate false discovery rates (FDRs), and $\sim$4\% of the genome was identified as being highly dissimilar or deleted relative to the reference genome sequence. Patterns of polymorphism are highly nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment having exceptional polymorphism levels. At the chromosomal scale, regional variation in polymorphism was readily apparent. A scan for recent selective sweeps revealed several candidate regions, including a notable example in which almost all variation was removed in a 500-kilobase window. Analyzing the polymorphisms we describe in larger sets of accessions will enable a detailed understanding of forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in A. thaliana.
Extensive variation in the genome sequences of 20 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana indicate a prominent role for biotic interactions in shaping its genetic diversity.

We employed a synthetic assay to identify natural hypermorphic F-box variants and then assayed auxin-associated phenotypes in accessions expressing these variants. To more directly measure the impact of the strongest variant in our synthetic assay on auxin sensitivity, we generated transgenic plants expressing this allele. Together, our findings link evolved sequence variation to altered molecular performance and auxin sensitivity.

Here we investigate a paracentric 1.17-Mb inversion on chromosome 4 of Arabidopsis thaliana with nucleotide precision of its borders. The inversion is created by Vandal transposon activity, splitting an F-box and relocating a pericentric heterochromatin segment in juxtaposition with euchromatin without affecting the epigenetic landscape. Examination of the RegMap panel and the 1001 Arabidopsis genomes revealed more than 170 inversion accessions in Europe and North America. The SNP patterns revealed historical recombinations from which we infer diverse haplotype patterns, ancient introgression events and phylogenetic relationships. We find a robust association between the inversion and fecundity under drought. We also find linkage disequilibrium between the inverted region and the early flowering Col-FRIGIDA allele. Finally, SNP analysis elucidates the origin of the inversion to South-Eastern Europe approximately 5000~years ago and the FRI-Col allele to North-West Europe, and reveals the spreading of a single haplotype to North America during the 17th to 19th century. The `American haplotype' was identified from several European localities, potentially due to return migration., Structural rearrangements redefine chromosomes, shape genome diversity and can have profound effects on selection, adaptation and spread. Here we elucidate the history of a paracentric inversion in Arabidopsis thaliana, including its origin a few thousand years ago, its maintenance under certain environmental conditions and its migration patterns, from Europe to North America and back.},

Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a model organism for the study of fundamental physiological, cellular, and molecular processes. It has also greatly advanced our understanding of intraspecific genome variation. We present a detailed map of variation in 1,135 high-quality re-sequenced natural inbred lines representing the native Eurasian and North African range and recently colonized North America. We identify relict populations that continue to inhabit ancestral habitats, primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. They have mixed with a lineage that has spread to northern latitudes from an unknown glacial refugium and is now found in a much broader spectrum of habitats. Insights into the history of the species and the fine-scale distribution of genetic diversity provide the basis for full exploitation of A.~thaliana natural variation through integration of genomes and epigenomes with molecular and non-molecular phenotypes.},

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans\textemdash{} the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

The summer enrichment program was also beneficial for science persistence variables, as evidenced by significant direct and indirect effects of the program on science course completion during students' third year of college and students' intentions to pursue a science research career assessed during the third year of college. In general, the program was equally beneficial for all participants, but ancillary analyses indicated added benefits with respect to task value for students with relatively lower prior science achievement during the first year of college and with respect to subsequent science course taking for males.

  abstract = {BackgroundMost eukaryotic genomes have undergone whole genome duplications during their evolutionary history. Recent studies have shown that the function of these duplicated genes can diverge from the ancestral gene via neo- or sub-functionalization within single genotypes. An additional possibility is that gene duplicates may also undergo partitioning of function among different genotypes of a species leading to genetic differentiation. Finally, the ability of gene duplicates to diverge may be limited by their biological function.Methodology/Principal FindingsTo test these hypotheses, I estimated the impact of gene duplication and metabolic function upon intraspecific gene expression variation of segmental and tandem duplicated genes within Arabidopsis thaliana. In all instances, the younger tandem duplicated genes showed higher intraspecific gene expression variation than the average Arabidopsis gene. Surprisingly, the older segmental duplicates also showed evidence of elevated intraspecific gene expression variation albeit typically lower than for the tandem duplicates. The specific biological function of the gene as defined by metabolic pathway also modulated the level of intraspecific gene expression variation. The major energy metabolism and biosynthetic pathways showed decreased variation, suggesting that they are constrained in their ability to accumulate gene expression variation. In contrast, a major herbivory defense pathway showed significantly elevated intraspecific variation suggesting that it may be under pressure to maintain and/or generate diversity in response to fluctuating insect herbivory pressures.ConclusionThese data show that intraspecific variation in gene expression is facilitated by an interaction of gene duplication and biological activity. Further, this plays a role in controlling diversity of plant metabolism.},

  abstract = {Comparison of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms within species with the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions between species has been widely used as a supposed indicator of positive Darwinian selection, with the ratio of these 2 ratios being designated as a neutrality index (NI). Comparison of genome-wide polymorphism within 12 species of bacteria with divergence from an outgroup species showed substantial differences in NI among taxa. A low level of nonsynonymous polymorphism at a locus was the best predictor of NI\,$<$\,1, rather than a high level of nonsynonymous substitution between species. Moreover, genes with NI\,$<$\,1 showed a strong tendency toward the occurrence of rare nonsynonymous polymorphisms, as expected under the action of ongoing purifying selection. Thus, our results are more consistent with the hypothesis that a high relative rate of between-species nonsynonymous substitution reflects mainly the action of purifying selection within species to eliminate slightly deleterious mutations rather than positive selection between species. This conclusion is consistent with previous results highlighting an important role of slightly deleterious variants in bacterial evolution and suggests caution in the use of the McDonald\textendash{}Kreitman test and related statistics as tests of positive selection.},

  issn = {1742-9994},
  doi = {10.1186/1742-9994-7-10},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methods of alignment masking, which refers to the technique of excluding alignment blocks prior to tree reconstructions, have been successful in improving the signal-to-noise ratio in sequence alignments. However, the lack of formally well defined methods to identify randomness in sequence alignments has prevented a routine application of alignment masking. In this study, we compared the effects on tree reconstructions of the most commonly used profiling method (GBLOCKS) which uses a predefined set of rules in combination with alignment masking, with a new profiling approach (ALISCORE) based on Monte Carlo resampling within a sliding window, using different data sets and alignment methods. While the GBLOCKS approach excludes variable sections above a certain threshold which choice is left arbitrary, the ALISCORE algorithm is free of a priori rating of parameter space and therefore more objective.
RESULTS: ALISCORE was successfully extended to amino acids using a proportional model and empirical substitution matrices to score randomness in multiple sequence alignments. A complex bootstrap resampling leads to an even distribution of scores of randomly similar sequences to assess randomness of the observed sequence similarity. Testing performance on real data, both masking methods, GBLOCKS and ALISCORE, helped to improve tree resolution. The sliding window approach was less sensitive to different alignments of identical data sets and performed equally well on all data sets. Concurrently, ALISCORE is capable of dealing with different substitution patterns and heterogeneous base composition. ALISCORE and the most relaxed GBLOCKS gap parameter setting performed best on all data sets. Correspondingly, Neighbor-Net analyses showed the most decrease in conflict.
CONCLUSIONS: Alignment masking improves signal-to-noise ratio in multiple sequence alignments prior to phylogenetic reconstruction. Given the robust performance of alignment profiling, alignment masking should routinely be used to improve tree reconstructions. Parametric methods of alignment profiling can be easily extended to more complex likelihood based models of sequence evolution which opens the possibility of further improvements.},

Unfortunately, variant library expression platforms in mammalian cells are far from ideal, hindering the study of human gene variants in their physiologically relevant cellular contexts.

First, a landing pad cell line with a genomically integrated, Tet-inducible cassette containing a Bxb1 recombination site is created. Second, a single variant from a library of transfected, promoter-less plasmids is recombined into the landing pad in each cell. Thus, every cell in the recombined pool expresses a single variant, allowing for parallel, sequencing-based assessment of variant effect. We describe a method for incorporating a single landing pad into a defined site of a cell line of interest, and show that our approach can be used generate more than 20 000 recombinant cells in a single experiment. Finally, we use our platform in combination with a sequencing-based assay to explore the N-end rule by simultaneously measuring the effects of all possible N-terminal amino acids on protein expression.},

We represent research problems as links between scientific entities in a knowledge network. We then build a generative model of discovery informed by qualitative research on scientific problem selection. We map salient features from this literature to key network properties: an entity's importance corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem's difficulty corresponds to the network distance it spans. Drawing on millions of papers and patents published over 30 years, we use this model to infer the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative research choices focused on building up knowledge around important molecules. These choices become more conservative over time. The observed strategy is efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for science as a whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more efficient at exploring mature knowledge networks. We find that increased risk-taking and the publication of experimental failures would substantially improve the speed of discovery. We consider institutional shifts in grant making, evaluation, and publication that would help realize these efficiencies.},

  doi = {10.1186/1756-0500-6-84},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana are a well-known system to measure levels of intraspecific genetic variation. Leaf starch content correlates negatively with biomass. Starch is synthesized by the coordinated action of many (iso)enzymes. Quantitatively dominant is the repetitive transfer of glucosyl residues to the non-reducing ends of $\alpha$-glucans as mediated by starch synthases. In the genome of A. thaliana, there are five classes of starch synthases, designated as soluble starch synthases (SSI, SSII, SSIII, and SSIV) and granule-bound synthase (GBSS). Each class is represented by a single gene. The five genes are homologous in functional domains due to their common origin, but have evolved individual features as well. Here, we analyze the extent of genetic variation in these fundamental protein classes as well as possible functional implications on transcript and protein levels.
FINDINGS: Intraspecific sequence variation of the five starch synthases was determined by sequencing the entire loci including promoter regions from 30 worldwide distributed accessions of A. thaliana. In all genes, a considerable number of nucleotide polymorphisms was observed, both in non-coding and coding regions, and several amino acid substitutions were identified in functional domains. Furthermore, promoters possess numerous polymorphisms in potentially regulatory cis-acting regions. By realtime experiments performed with selected accessions, we demonstrate that DNA sequence divergence correlates with significant differences in transcript levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Except for AtSSII, all starch synthase classes clustered into two or three groups of haplotypes, respectively. Significant difference in transcript levels among haplotype clusters in AtSSIV provides evidence for cis-regulation. By contrast, no such correlation was found for AtSSI, AtSSII, AtSSIII, and AtGBSS, suggesting trans-regulation. The expression data presented here point to a regulation by common trans-regulatory transcription factors which ensures a coordinated action of the products of these four genes during starch granule biosynthesis. The apparent cis-regulation of AtSSIV might be related to its role in the initiation of de novo biosynthesis of granules.},

  abstract = {Genetic variation within and between species can be shaped by population-level processes and mutation; however, the relative impact of ``survival of the fittest'' and ``arrival of the fittest'' on phenotypic evolution remains unclear. Assessing the influence of mutation on evolution requires understanding the relative rates of different types of mutations and their genetic properties, yet little is known about the functional consequences of new mutations. Here, we examine the spectrum of mutations affecting a focal gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by characterizing 231 novel haploid genotypes with altered activity of a fluorescent reporter gene. 7\% of these genotypes had a nonsynonymous mutation in the coding sequence for the fluorescent protein and were classified as ``coding'' mutants; 2\% had a change in the S. cerevisiae TDH3 promoter sequence controlling expression of the fluorescent protein and were classified as ``cis-regulatory'' mutants; 10\% contained two copies of the reporter gene and were classified as ``copy number'' mutants; and the remaining 81\% showed altered fluorescence without a change in the reporter gene itself and were classified as ``trans-acting'' mutants. As a group, coding mutants had the strongest effect on reporter gene activity and always decreased it. By contrast, 50\%\textendash{}95\% of the mutants in each of the other three classes increased gene activity, with mutants affecting copy number and cis-regulatory sequences having larger median effects on gene activity than trans-acting mutants. When made heterozygous in diploid cells, coding, cis-regulatory, and copy number mutant genotypes all had significant effects on gene activity, whereas 88\% of the trans-acting mutants appeared to be recessive. These differences in the frequency, effects, and dominance among functional classes of mutations might help explain why some types of mutations are found to be segregating within or fixed between species more often than others.},

  abstract = {Genetic variation segregating within a species reflects the combined activities of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. In the absence of selection, polymorphisms are expected to be a random subset of new mutations; thus, comparing the effects of polymorphisms and new mutations provides a test for selection. When evidence of selection exists, such comparisons can identify properties of mutations that are most likely to persist in natural populations. Here we investigate how mutation and selection have shaped variation in a cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression by empirically determining the effects of polymorphisms segregating in the TDH3 promoter among 85 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comparing their effects to a distribution of mutational effects defined by 236 point mutations in the same promoter. Surprisingly, we find that selection on expression noise (that is, variability in expression among genetically identical cells) appears to have had a greater impact on sequence variation in the TDH3 promoter than selection on mean expression level. This is not necessarily because variation in expression noise impacts fitness more than variation in mean expression level, but rather because of differences in the distributions of mutational effects for these two phenotypes. This study shows how systematically examining the effects of new mutations can enrich our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. It also provides rare empirical evidence of selection acting on expression noise.},

  abstract = {Biochemical, molecular and genetic studies emphasize the role of the potato vacuolar invertase Pain-1 in the accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers upon cold storage, and thereby its influence on the quality of potato chips and French fries. Previous studies showed that natural Pain-1 cDNA alleles were associated with better chip quality and higher tuber starch content. In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of these alleles. A genotype-dependent transient increase of total Pain-1 transcript levels in cold-stored tubers of six different genotypes as well as allele-specific expression patterns were detected. 3D modelling revealed putative structural differences between allelic Pain-1 proteins at the molecule's surface and at the substrate binding site. Furthermore, the yeast SUC2 mutant was complemented with Pain-1 cDNA alleles and enzymatic parameters of the heterologous expressed proteins were measured at 30 and 4$\quad{}^\circ$C. Significant differences between the alleles were detected. The observed functional differences between Pain-1 alleles did not permit final conclusions on the mechanism of their association with tuber quality traits. Our results show that natural allelic variation at the functional level is present in potato, and that the heterozygous genetic background influences the manifestation of this variation.},

  abstract = {Gene expression microarrays allow rapid and easy quantification of transcript accumulation for almost transcripts present in a genome. This technology has been utilized for diverse investigations from studying gene regulation in response to genetic or environmental fluctuation to global expression QTL (eQTL) analyses of natural variation. Typical analysis techniques focus on responses of individual genes in isolation of other genes. However, emerging evidence indicates that genes are organized into regulons, i.e., they respond as groups due to individual transcription factors binding multiple promoters, creating what is commonly called a network. We have developed a set of statistical approaches that allow researchers to test specific network hypothesis using a priori-defined gene networks. When applied to Arabidopsis thaliana this approach has been able to identify natural genetic variation that controls networks. In this chapter we describe approaches to develop and test specific network hypothesis utilizing natural genetic variation. This approach can be expanded to facilitate direct tests of the relationship between phenotypic trait and transcript genetic architecture. Finally, the use of a priori network definitions can be applied to any microarray experiment to directly conduct hypothesis testing at a genomics level.},
